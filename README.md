# 🚇 Guess That Metro! - Amsterdam Edition

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little Amsterdam metro guessing game. Ever thought you knew Amsterdam's metro system like the back of your hand? Well, time to prove it! 

## 🎮 What's This All About?

It's pretty simple really - I'll show you a zoomed-in view of a metro station somewhere in Amsterdam, and you've got to figure out which one it is. But here's the fun part:

- 🎯 You get 3 shots at guessing the right station
- 🔍 Each wrong guess? The map zooms out a bit to give you more context
- 🗺️ Street names are visible to help you navigate
- 🎉 Get it right and... CONFETTI! (because who doesn't love confetti?)

## 🚀 Wanna Try It Out?

1. Clone this bad boy:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umutevren/amsterdam-metro-guesser.git
   cd amsterdam-metro-guesser
   ```
2. Install the goodies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Fire it up!
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🎯 How to Play

1. You'll start with a super zoomed-in view of a metro station
2. Type your guess in the input field
3. If you're wrong, the map zooms out to show more of the surroundings
4. Keep trying until you get it right or run out of attempts!
