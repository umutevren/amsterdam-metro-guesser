# 🚇 Guess That Metro! - Amsterdam Edition

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my little Amsterdam metro guessing game. Ever thought you knew Amsterdam's metro system like the back of your hand? Well, time to prove it! 

## 🎮 What's This All About?

It's pretty simple really - I'll show you a zoomed-in view of a metro station somewhere in Amsterdam, and you've got to figure out which one it is. But here's the fun part:

- 🎯 You get 3 shots at guessing the right station
- 🔍 Each wrong guess? The map zooms out a bit to give you more context
- 🎉 Get it right and... CONFETTI! (because who doesn't love confetti?)

## 🚀 Wanna Try It Out?

1. First, grab yourself a Mapbox token from [here](https://account.mapbox.com/)
2. Clone this bad boy:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-url]
   cd adam-metro
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file and drop your Mapbox token in there:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_super_secret_token
   ```
4. Install the goodies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Fire it up!
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🛠 Built With
